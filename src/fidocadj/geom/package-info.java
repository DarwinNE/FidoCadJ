/** <p>
    Perform all kinds of geometrical operations: coordinate mapping, calculate
    distances between a graphical element and a given pointer...
    Probably, the most important class here is MapCoordinates, which
    contains information about the coordinate mapping, which is changed
    during zoom operations and so on.
