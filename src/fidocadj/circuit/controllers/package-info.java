/**<p>
 The package circuit.controllers contains classes useful for modify
 the drawing stored in the circuit.model.DrawingModel class.
 They contain the code needed for parsing the drawing code, to take care of
 undo operations (with some limitations when libraries are taken into account)
 as well as interaction with the pointing device.</p>
 <p>Each controller class implements a certain number of "actions" (hence the
 name of the classes) to be performed on the model specified generally during
 the construction.
