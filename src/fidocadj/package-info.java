/**<p>
    Main classes for the FidoCadJ project:
    FidoMain contains the entry point of the stand alone Swing application,
    FidoFrame contains the main window of the application.
    The other classes handle ancillary operations such as specific code
    dedicated to the user interface (MenuTools, ExportTools, etc...).
    FidoCadApplet is the launching code for FidoCadJ running in an applet
    (it is becoming obsolete by now).</p>
