## 🎯 About FidoCadJ

### What is FidoCadJ?

FidoCadJ is a modern, multiplatform electronic design automation (EDA) software with a vast library of electrical symbols and footprints (both through-hole and SMD). It serves as an easy-to-use editor for creating electrical schematics and printed circuit board layouts.

**Origins:** FidoCadJ is the successor to the original FidoCAD, a popular vector graphic editor that gained widespread adoption in the Italian Usenet community during the late 1990s. The original software used a compact text-based file format, perfect for sharing in newsgroups and forums.

**Modern Evolution:** FidoCadJ brings the simplicity of FidoCAD into the modern era with:
- Full UTF-8 text support
- Advanced features and professional output
- Internationalization
- Sleek, anti-aliased user interface
- Multiple export formats (PDF, EPS, PGF for LaTeX, SVG, PNG, JPG)

> **Note:** FidoCadJ is a graphical drawing tool without netlist functionality. This provides maximum flexibility as a vector drawing application but does not include circuit simulation capabilities.

### ✨ Key Features

- 📐 Extensive library of electrical components and footprints
- 🎨 Multiple export formats (PDF, EPS, SVG, PNG, JPG, PGF)
- 🌍 Multilingual interface (English, French, Italian, Spanish, German, Chinese, Dutch, Japanese, Greek, Czech)
- 📱 Cross-platform compatibility
- 🔧 Simple mechanical drawing capabilities
- 🎯 Easy to learn and use

### 📚 Community Libraries

FidoCadJ comes with a built-in library of components, but the community has created many additional libraries to extend its capabilities! You can download specialized libraries for various purposes:

🔗 **[Browse and Download Community Libraries](https://fidocadj.github.io/FidoCadJ/docs/libraries/)**

These community-contributed libraries include:
- Additional electronic components
- Specialized symbols and footprints
- Industry-specific elements
- Custom mechanical parts
- And much more!

Simply download the library files and import them into FidoCadJ to expand your component collection.

### 💻 Supported Platforms

| Platform | Requirements |
|----------|-------------|
| **Windows** | Windows 7, 8, 10, 11 with Java 9+ |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

#### Windows

Download `FidoCadJ_Windows.msi` from the [releases page](https://github.com/FidoCadJ/FidoCadJ/releases) and run the installer. Launch FidoCadJ from the Start menu.

#### macOS

1. Download `FidoCadJ_MacOSX.dmg` from the [releases page](https://github.com/FidoCadJ/FidoCadJ/releases)
2. Open the DMG file and drag FidoCadJ to your Applications folder

> 📝 **Note:** The application bundle is self-sufficient and includes everything needed to run. You don't need to install Java separately.

**⚠️ macOS Gatekeeper Issue:**

Recent macOS versions may show a **very misleading error** when trying to run FidoCadJ:

> _"FidoCadJ.app is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Trash."_

**This is NOT true!** The application is not damaged. This is a security feature that prevents running apps from unidentified developers. The error message is misleading and doesn't explain the real issue.

**What's happening:**
- macOS activates the "quarantine" extended attribute on downloaded files
- The system refuses to run software with this attribute
- On some Macs (like M1/M2), you may be asked to install Rosetta first

**Example of the error (macOS Ventura 13.3):**

![macOS Gatekeeper Error](OSes/mac/error_macOS.png)

**Solution - Follow these steps:**

1. **Remove the quarantine attribute:**
   Open Terminal and type:
   ```bash
   xattr -c /Applications/FidoCadJ.app
   ```
   *(If you haven't moved it to Applications yet, use the actual path to the file)*
   
   > ⚠️ You need admin access and may need to authorize Terminal.app to modify files

2. **Right-click on FidoCadJ.app** and select **"Open"** (don't double-click)

3. **Confirm** when the system asks if you really want to run the software downloaded from an untrusted source

**Need help?** See [Issue #198](https://github.com/FidoCadJ/FidoCadJ/issues/198) for discussion and alternative solutions.

> 💡 If you know a way to solve this without using Terminal, please share it in the GitHub issue!

#### Linux

**Method 1: Using the JAR file**
```bash
java -jar fidocadj.jar
```

**Method 2: Build from source**
```bash
make
sudo make install
```

#### Android

Download the APK file from the [official GitHub releases page](https://github.com/FidoCadJ/FidoCadJ/releases) and install it on your device.

> ⚠️ **Security Note:** Only download FidoCadJ from the official GitHub repository to ensure authenticity.

### Quick Start

1. **Launch FidoCadJ** using your preferred method
2. **Create a new drawing** from the File menu
3. **Select components** from the extensive library
4. **Design your schematic** using the intuitive interface
5. **Export** to your desired format (PDF, PNG, SVG, etc.)

💡 **Pro Tip:** Expand your component collection by downloading [community libraries](https://fidocadj.github.io/FidoCadJ/docs/libraries/)!

} else {
    // Else body
}
```

**Classes:**
```java
class ExampleClass
{
    // Class members
}
```

#### Code Quality Tools

We maintain high code quality using:

- **Checkstyle:** Enforces coding standards (`dev_tools/rules.xml`)
- **PMD:** Static code analysis (`dev_tools/pmd.sh`)
- **FindBugs:** Bug detection on compiled JAR
- **Copy/Paste Detection:** Identifies code duplication

> 🎯 **Before submitting a pull request**, run Checkstyle with `dev_tools/rules.xml` to ensure compliance!
