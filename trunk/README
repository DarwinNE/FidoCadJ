1 - Introduction
----------------

FidoCadJ is a very easy to use editor, with a vast library of electrical 
symbols and footprints (through hole and SMD). Drawings can be exported in 
several graphic formats (PDF, EPS, PGF for LaTeX, SVG, PNG, JPG). Even if it 
is very simple and somewhat limited, FidoCadJ can be very useful as a basic
Electronic  design automation (EDA) software. FidoCadJ is inspired from FidoCad 
(without "J"), which was a vector graphic editor useful for electrical 
schematics and printed circuit boards. It uses a file format containing 
only UTF-8 text, very compact and suited for copy and pasting from/into 
newsgroups and forum messages. 
This determined its success among the italian Usenet community, from late 
'90s, as it is quite versatile for simple mechanical drawings as well. 
FidoCadJ is internationalized and its manual is available in english, french 
and italian. The user interface has been translated into english, french, 
italian, spanish and german.

First, a few useful sites about FidoCadJ:
http://tinyurl.com/yavewp2
http://sourceforge.net/projects/fidocadj/

If you own a PC running Linux or Windows (or any system supporting Java), you
may download from the SourceForge repository the file fidocadj.jar. If Java
is correctly installed on your machine, you may just double click on it to 
run FidoCadJ. If you are a command line guy, you may enter the directory
where the file fidocadj.jar has been saved and type

	java -jar fidocadj.jar
	
If you own an Apple Macintosh with MacOSX, you may download the FidoCadJ.app
bundle and treat it just like any other native application. Since Apple does
not seem to be very much prone to support Java, if you experience some 
problems running FidoCadJ, please check you do have a Java runtime 
correctly installed on your Mac. This is particularly true if you are using
the MacOSX Lion operating system.

Remember that if there is a greek letter after the version number of FidoCadJ,
this means that you are using a preliminary version of this program. 
Basically, you are warned: those version may be unstable!

3 - Instructions about compiling and running FidoCadJ
-----------------------------------------------------

Ok, you just checkout from SourceForge SVN the FidoCadJ source files. Good :-)
FidoCadJ is a pure Java project, and for many reasons I prefer using a good
text editor as well as a few command line scripts, in order to compile and run 
the code on which I am working.
You will thus find in the trunk directory (see section 2 of this 
file) several scripts which will be useful for you, expecially if you are
working in an Unix-like environment.
If you prefer using some kind of IDE such as Eclipse, you may try it, but I
do not provide assistance about it and I will always refer to the scripts
I wrote.

3.1 Compile and run the sources on a MacOSX operating system (>=1.3.9) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are using MacOSX, you just open up a terminal window, go into the 
fidocadj/trunk directory and type:

  ./rebuild mac

And FidoCadJ should be automatically compiled and run. You can use the 
following script to create a jar archive in the jar/ directory:

  ./createjar

3.2 Compile and run the sources on an Unix system
-------------------------------------------------

FidoCadJ can be compiled on an Unix system by using the following command into
the fidocadj/trunk directory:

  ./rebuild
  
FidoCadJ should compile and run. You can use the following script to create 
a jar archive in the jar/ directory:

  ./createjar

3.3 Compile and run the sources on an Windows system
----------------------------------------------------

The provided scripts do not work on Microsoft Windows. You should handle 
manually the compilation with the following command, from fidocadj\trunk:

javac  -g -O -sourcepath src -classpath bin -source 1.4 -target 1.4 .\src\FidoMain.java -d bin

to launch the compiled program, you should type:

java  -classpath ".\bin:.\jar:.\jar\"  FidoMain

FidoCadJ should be launched.

3.4 Coding conventions
----------------------

The following coding conventions have been applied for the FidoCadJ source 
code:

- tab set to 4 spaces
- blocks delimited by curly braces are indented as follows:

    for(i=0; i<10; ++i) {   // starting brace here
        // indented code (4 spaces)
        System.out.println("I counted up to "+i);
    }   // close brace here at the same level of the 'if'
    
- methods are indented as follows:

    void dummy (int i, int j) 
    {   // put the starting brace here
        System.out.println("Indent code");
    }   // put the closing brace here

- the class names always start with a capital letter, and so does methods
- variables never start with a capital letter
- an instance of the class does have its first letter in lower case
- each public class and method should be documented with Javadoc syntax
- no lines longer than 80 characters
- commits should not break the build


3.5 Automatic tests
-------------------

To ease the maintain of a certain degree of quality control when working 
on the source code, the FidoCadJ source repository comes with a number of 
automatic tests scripts contained in the directory test/.
You may launch all the tests by using the script all_tests.sh contained
in this directory, or you may run the tests individually by browsing the
sub-directories containing them. The program is called by using the 
fidocadj.jar archive which must be contained in the jar/ directory. 
Ensure that this archive is updated with the ./createjar script before
launching any test.
The following table briefly describes the provided tests:

  Test                             Comments
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  test/export/test_export.sh       Test the export on all available
                                   file format. A set of reference 
                                   files is provided, so it might be
                                   updated if differences on the 
                                   export are introduced by purpouse.
                                   If a test is failed, this tells just that
                                   the exported file is not identical to the
                                   model which has been used. You may have a 
                                   look at the log file and at the result of 
                                   the export. You may decide that it is ok.

  test/messages/test_messages.sh   Test the coherence of all 
                                   installed languages again the 
                                   reference (which is the italian!)

4 - Help wanted!
----------------

I am seeking for people interested in participating to the FidoCadJ project.
If you spot a typo (I am not a native English speaker), or an error in the 
manual or in the program, any correction is very welcome. I will be very happy 
to know what do you think about FidoCadJ. I would be glad to receive some 
help: if you know Java and you want to work on the source code you will be 
welcome.
If your Java coding is not fluent, you can participate to the project by 
improving the manuals or translating the interface, or just giving an advice. 
Feel free to contact me at davbucciNOPE@tiscali.it, or in the SourceForge 
forums (the email address is valid without the nope part, but no 
attachments, please). It is probably better to open a discussion in the 
SourceForge forums, in order that the work can eventually be shared and
organized between all developers.

4.1 "I want to translate FidoCadJ in my language"
-------------------------------------------------

FidoCadJ is written in such a way that translating its interface is 
particularly easy and does not need any programming skills.
If you have downloaded the source file repository, you should find the 
interface resource files in the trunk/bin directory.
A language resource file has the name MessagesBundle_xx.properties, where
xx is the code for the language to which the translation is targeted.
If you have a look at the beginning of the file 
trunk/bin/MessagesBundle_en.properties, you should read something as 
follow:

	File = File
	New = New
	Open = Open file
	Save = Save
	SaveName = Save as...
	Export = Export
	Print = Print
	Close = Close

	...

The resources strings are organized in the form key = value. For example, here 
is the head of the corresponding file for the interface in French, in the file
trunk/bin/MessagesBundle_fr.properties

	File = Fichier
	New = Nouveau dessin
	Open = Ouvre un fichier
	Save = Enregistrer
	SaveName = Enregistrer sous un autre nom
	Export = Exporter
	Print = Impression
	Close = Fermer

	...

That is all. If you want to translate FidoCadJ in your language, you just have
to translate line by line the values in a language resource file, name it 
accordingly to your locale and place it in the trunk/bin directory.
Pay attention that sometimes there are spaces at the end of the value 
strings which need to be kept in place. You may be careful about always 
providing complete files, since if a resource is missing, FidoCadJ can abort. 

4.2 "I would like to participate to the coding activity"
--------------------------------------------------------

This is very nice from you. We will be happy for that. You can manifest 
yourself on the SourceForum forums dedicated to FidoCadJ and declare what are
your skills and basically what you would like to do. We will discuss a little
in order to see if we can find an intersection between what you can do with 
the FidoCadJ development strategy. The idea is to keep the work a little bit 
organized and to know who does what. Have a peek to section 3.3 of this readme 
file to see what coding style should be applied to the sources.
Apart from that, FidoCadJ is GPL v.3 and this means that if you have the mood
for, you can download with SVN the source files and play *as you want* with
them. But keep in mind that if you want your contributions be included in the
FidoCadJ main stream, you MUST keep in touch with us in the SF forums and you
must discuss about what are you willing to do. 

Once you decide what you want to do, you can run the Javadoc utility in order
to get a HTML description of all classes used in FidoCadJ. You will find that
useful to understand the underpinnings of the program. To do that, you can
run the trunk/createdoc sh script, if you are in a Unix system.

Then comes the hard work... We can help you! Please come to the SourceForge
forums dedicated to FidoCadJ!

4.3 Things to do
----------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review on SourceForge or OhLoh      It is important that the users and 
                                    developers of FidoCadJ understand what is 
                                    good and what is bad in their favourite 
                                    software. Do not be shy to review FidoCadJ 
                                    on SourceForge or OhLoh!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Translate user interface            Everything is done on FidoCadJ to make it 
                                    easy to translate its interface in any 
                                    language. You can significatively 
                                    contribute to the spread of FidoCadJ in 
                                    your country!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Translate manual                    This is an hard work, but it will be very 
                                    welcomed by the users of your country. You 
                                    will probably need an idea on how LaTeX
                                    works.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
YouTube video tutorial              I will put on the FidoCadJ's page a link to 
                                    the best video tutorials about FidoCadJ on 
                                    YouTube. Why don't you give it a try?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Report bugs                         Use the bug and artifact tracking system of
                                    SourceForge or drop me an email.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Export in Gerber format             Exporting in graphical vector formats is 
                                    easy with FidoCadJ. If you want to add a 
                                    file format you just need to know it and 
                                    implement a Java interface. Gerber is 
                                    highly requested by people working on PCBs.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Export in WMF/EMF formats           WMF/EMF are widely used in Windows and they 
                                    may be useful for including drawings in 
                                    vector format in Microsoft Word or Power 
                                    Point.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows installer                   FidoCadJ does not come with a standard 
                                    Windows installer. Can you prepare one?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Linux packaging                     FidoCadJ could be distributed as a deb or a 
                                    RPM package. Can you prepare one?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


--------------------
5 - I found a bug...
--------------------

Every program contains bugs and FidoCadJ is not an exception. Even if all 
the people involved in the development of FidoCadJ pay a lot of attention
at each release, some details could just go unnoticed.
If you ar familiar with the SourceForge interface, do not hesitate to
fill a bug report at the following address:

http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=274886&atid=1167996

If you feel uncomfortable with the SourceForge system, please drop a few
