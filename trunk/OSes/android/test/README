		FidoCadJ for Android
		
By Davide Bucci, 2014

This folder contains the complete sources of the FidoCadJ for Android 
application.
This app shares a lot of files with the main program running on PC's using
Swing.
Those files are present in the source arborescence by means of symbolic links.
So, please use a decent operating system allowing you to use symbolic links for
files, if you want to contribute to the coding.
You may also notice that in some case different files with the same name and
package are present for the Swing version and the Android version.
This is because those files need some version-specific features.

Resources

The primary resources are always those for the Swing application. For this 
reason, if you need to add a string, modify the resource files of the
Swing application (/bin/*.resources) and then run res.sh script.
