FidoCadJ can run successfully on computers equipped with recent versions of
the Apple macOS operating system. Unfortunately, changes to the Apple policy
regarding how software is currently distributed can generate a very misleading 
error the first time FidoCadJ is run on Macintosh computers.

Here is the GitHub issue: https://github.com/DarwinNE/FidoCadJ/issues/198

I tried downloading FidoCadJ 0.24.8 on a brand new MacBook Pro M2, running
macOS Ventura 13.0.

At first the system asks to download and install Rosetta.
Then, the unfortunate message "FidoCadJ.app is damaged and canâ€™t be opened. You
should move it to the Trash" is shown when one tries to launch the program,
even after I moved it in the Applications folder.

To fix this I had to do three things:

1 - Open a terminal and type xattr -c /Applications/FidoCadJ.app (if you have
    already copied FidoCadJ.app on the Applications folder. Otherwise, specify
    the path to the file in your system.)
2 - Right click on the executable and select "open".
3 - Then, the system asks me if I really want to run the software (downloaded
    on an untrusted source). I selected "Yes" (at your risk and peril!)

The xattr stuff is required because macOS activates the extended attribute
"quarantine" on the downloaded file. The system refuses to run software with
this attribute and shows the error. The error is very misleading because it
lets the user think that the archive is corrupted even if it is not the case!

If you have a way to solve this problem that does not require accessing to the
terminal, please participate to the GitHub issue linked above.
