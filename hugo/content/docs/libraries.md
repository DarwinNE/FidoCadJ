# Libraries and symbols

You can **freely download** user-contributed libraries of symbols from here. To install them in FidoCadJ, you should choose a directory in your computer, un-compress the downloaded file there. You will find one or several files with the fcl (FidoCadJ library) extension.

**On Windows:** in FidoCadJ, go in the File menu, click on Options. In the "startup" tab select the directory containing the files with the fcl extension.

**On macOS:** in the FidoCadJ menu, go in the program settings and in the "startup" tab select the directory containing the files with the fcl extension.
